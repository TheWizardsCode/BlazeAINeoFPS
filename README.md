## Contributing

We welcome your contributions to this demo game created with Universal AI and NeoFPS. Help us make these assets shine. It would be truly awesome if this got to be so good that one or both publishers could use the game to sell their assets. Lets make it happen so they keep building what we need to make games.

### Navigating the Project

The following folders have content that are a part of the project:

`Assets/_Dev` contains some dev scenes used for testing of the AI
`Assets/_BlazeNeo` contains the actual game scenes and assets using only BlazeAI and Neo FPS

There are other folders, but you might as well ignore them as they require additional assets and if not documented are still not usable. That said, feel free to poke around.
