  m_Description: 'Your mission is to clear out the military town of TunTuk. You will
    have 10 minutes between arrival and the opening of the extraction gate.


    You
    must gather at least 1000 clearance points and neutralize Kivo Kinvol, the Unit
    leader for this base. Kivo has been marked so you recognize them when you see
    them.


    Good Luck.'
